# 🧪 **SECURITY TESTING PLAN - CRITICAL**

## **🚨 YOU MUST TEST THESE SCENARIOS**

Your Firestore rules are deployed, but you need to verify they're working correctly.

## **TEST 1: Single User Verification** ✅
**What you should see:**
- ✅ You can login with your account
- ✅ You can see your inventory items
- ✅ You can add/edit/delete your own items
- ✅ App works normally for you

## **TEST 2: Multi-Tenant Isolation** 🔥 **CRITICAL**

### **Step 1: Create a Second Test Account**
1. Register a new user in your app with a different email
2. Login with this new account
3. Add at least 2-3 inventory items
4. Note: This creates a separate "practice" 

### **Step 2: Test Data Isolation**
**Switch between accounts and verify:**

| Test | Account 1 | Account 2 | Expected Result |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| View Inventory | See own items only | See own items only | ✅ **PASS** - No cross-contamination |
| Item Count | Shows own count | Shows own count | ✅ **PASS** - Correct totals |
| Search | Finds own items only | Finds own items only | ✅ **PASS** - No leakage |
| Dashboard Stats | Own stats only | Own stats only | ✅ **PASS** - Isolated metrics |

## **TEST 3: Security Violation Attempts** 🛡️

### **Browser Developer Tools Test:**
1. Open your app in Chrome
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Perform some inventory actions
5. **Check:** No data from other practices should appear in network requests

### **Firebase Console Verification:**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Check your data - you should see items from both test accounts
4. **Critical:** Verify your app rules prevent unauthorized access

## **TEST 4: Error Handling Verification**

Your app should gracefully handle:
- ✅ Network errors
- ✅ Permission denied errors  
- ✅ Invalid data attempts
- ✅ Unauthorized access attempts

---

## **🚨 SECURITY RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR**

**❌ IMMEDIATE CONCERN - Contact support if you see:**
- Data from other practices appearing in your app
- Ability to edit items you didn't create
- Network requests returning unauthorized data
- JavaScript console errors about permissions

**✅ GOOD SIGNS:**
- Each user only sees their own data
- Clean separation between practices
- "Permission denied" errors when appropriate
- Network requests only return authorized data

---

## **📱 TESTING PROCEDURE**

### **Quick Test (5 minutes):**
1. Login with your main account
2. Note the number of inventory items
3. Logout and create new account  
4. Add 2-3 items with new account
5. Switch back to main account
6. **Verify:** Item count unchanged, can't see new items

### **Thorough Test (15 minutes):**
1. Create 2 separate test accounts
2. Add inventory, locations, treatment kits to each
3. Switch between accounts multiple times
4. Verify complete data isolation
5. Test all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
6. Check browser network tab for data leakage

---

## **✅ SECURITY SIGN-OFF CHECKLIST**

After testing, confirm:
- [ ] Multiple user accounts only see their own data
- [ ] No cross-practice data contamination
- [ ] All CRUD operations properly restricted
- [ ] Browser network tab shows no unauthorized data
- [ ] Firebase Console shows proper rule enforcement
- [ ] App shows appropriate error messages for denied access

---

## **🆘 IF TESTS FAIL**

**If you see data from other users:**
1. Double-check the Firestore rules were deployed correctly
2. Verify the rules match the recommended production rules
3. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules tab
4. Clear browser cache and test again
5. Contact support if issues persist

**Your app is only secure if these tests PASS!** 🛡️

---

## **🎉 SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**✅ You're ready for production when:**
- All tests pass
- Complete multi-tenant isolation verified
- No security red flags observed
- Team members can independently verify security
- Firebase Console shows active rule enforcement

**Test these scenarios now to confirm your app is secure!**
